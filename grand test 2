The University Grants Commissions directive to college and university lecturers to spend a minimum of 22 hours a week in direct teaching is the product Of budgetary cutbacks rather than pedagogic wisdom. It may seem odd, at first blush, that teachers should protest about teaching a mere 22 hours. However, If one considers the amount of time academics require to prepare lectures of good qualify as well as the time they need to spend doing research, It is clear that most conscientious teacher's work more than 40 hours a week. In university systems around the world, lecturers rarely spend more than 12 to 15 hours In direct teaching activities a week. The average college lecturer in India does not have any office space.

If computers are available, internet connectivity is unlikely. Libraries are poorly stocked. Now the UGC says universities must implement a complete freeze on all permanent recruitment, abolish all posts which have been vacant for more than a year, and cut staff strength by 10 percent. And it is in order to ensure that these cutbacks do not affect the quantum of teaching that existing lecturers are being asked to work longer. Obviously, the quality of teaching and academic work in general will decline. While it is true that some college teachers do not take their classes regularly, the UGC and the Institutions concerned must find a proper way to hold them accountable. An absentee teacher will continue to play truant even if the number of hours he is required to teach goes up.

All of us are well aware of the unsound state that the Indian higher education system is in today. Thanks to years of sustained financial neglect most Indian universities and colleges do no research worth the name. Even as the number of students entering colleges has increased dramatically, public investment in higher education has actually declined in relative terms. Between 1985 and 1997, when public expenditure on higher education as a percentage of outlays on all levels of education grew by more than 60 percent in Malaysia and 20 percent in Thailand, India showed a decline of more than 10 percent. Throughout the world, the number of teachers in higher education per million population grew by more than 10 percent In the same period in India it fell by one percent. Instead of transferring the burden of government apathy on to the backs of the teachers, the UGC should insist that the needs of the country's university system are adequately catered for.
