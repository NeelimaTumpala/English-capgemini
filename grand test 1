Read the following passage and answer the questions below.

The stunning Baltimore Oriole is a common summer visitor to eastern and mid western deciduous woodlands, neighbourhoods, and gardens. Baltimore Orioles winter in the tropics. About 7 inches in length, the male Baltimore Oriole has a black head, throat, back and wings. Its breast, stomach, and rump are bright orange. It also has an orange patch on the top of each wing and white wing bars. The tail is mostly black with orange fringes. The female is dull orange throughout.

Baltimore Orioles range throughout the eastern and mid western United States, and can be found as far west as the Dakotas. At the western edge of their range, Baltimore Orioles may breed with the Bullock's Oriole (They were once considered the same species under the name Northern Oriole).

Baltimore Orioles build unusual pouch like nests that hang down from branches. They usually nest high in the trees, but often come down to lower heights, flashing bright orange and black feathers to delighted observers Active and acrobatic by nature, Baltimore Orioles may even feed upside down at time.

Baltimore Orioles eat insects and berries. They can easily be attracted to gardens by nailing orange wedges to tree branches. Baltirmore Orioles are also known to feed at hummingbird feeders and sapsucker wells.
